  Fix build as subproject without building documentation

  * meson.build: If mm-common-get is not found in maintainer-mode
  with 'required: false', try with 'required: true'.
  Don't try to use tag_file, if documentation is not built.
  * docs/reference/meson.build: Don't use variables from modules
  that don't define doxytagfile. These are subprojects that don't build
  their documentation.

  Visual Studio builds: Clean up build files

  glibmm will be updated to be clear of classes that export items making the
  built binaries dependent on the exact compiler version and the STL version,
  which will eliminate the need to ignore warnings C4251, C4273 and C4275.
  
  We will also use the /EHsc compiler flag so that we can also drop the
  ignore on warning C4530.

  NMake Makefiles: Fix gendef invocation

  We ought to pass in the DLL filename with the '.dll' extension to gendef, not
  just the .lib filename.

2020-07-23  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Use Meson-style DLL and .lib naming if requested

  To make things more consistent and less prone to confusion, if 'USE_MESON_LIBS'
  is specified in the NMake command line, build the DLLs and .lib's that are
  named like the Meson counterparts.  Binaries built with Meson+Visual Studio
  and the ones that are built via NMake using 'USE_MESON_LIBS' are
  interchangeable, provided that they are built with the same Visual Studio
  version.

2020-07-22  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Fix generating pangomm[config.h|.rc]

  The previous additions to generate those files accidentally made the build
  attempt to generate them, even if done from a release tarball that is done by
  the autotools builds.
  
  This will fix this situation, and improve the situation that if pangomm.rc or
  pangommconfig.h needs to be generated, these files will be generated
  automatically

  NMake Makefiles: Fix previous commit

  We should also account for Visual Studio 2015 when we use 'USE_MESON_LIBS' with
  'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' as well...

2020-06-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  README.win32: Update Meson build info

  It is now possible to build Pango directly from a GIT checkout on Visual Studio
  builds for a while, so let people know about this.
  
  Also note that glibmm and cairomm should be built with Meson in order to use the
  Meson build files for pangomm, and one should also use the same compiler to
  build pangomm, glibmm and cairomm.

2020-06-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Use the /utf-8 compiler flag

  This makes it easier to build pangomm on non-Western locales, without requiring
  to change the "Locale settings for non-Unicode programs" to English, which will
  require a restart, since warning (error) C4819 can be otherwise triggered, which
  can indicate broken builds due to Unicode handling issues in the compiler.

2020-06-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Apply toolset version for Meson-built deps

  As the Meson build files for Visual Studio apply the toolset version in the
  .lib filenames by default, apply the toolset version in the Meson-built -mm
  .lib files that we link in, just as we did when we we link in the -mm .lib
  files that was built with NMake, by default.
  
  The option 'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' will also mean that we will use the former
  behavior when we link in the Meson-built -mm .lib's, just as we did when we
  link in the NMake-built -mm .lib's.

2020-06-29  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjellahlstedt@gmail.com>

  docs/reference/: Update for Doxygen >= 1.8.16

  * docs/reference/meson.build: Doxygen 1.8.16 and later does not store
  tag file names in the html files. This requires changes in meson.build
  and in doc-install.pl (in mm-common). Otherwise references to other modules
  won't be updated in the html files when they are installed.
  * docs/reference/Doxyfile.in: Remove PERL_PATH and MSCGEN_PATH.
  Doxygen since version 1.8.0 does not use them.

2020-06-29  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson/Visual Studio builds: Include toolset version by default

  This makes the built DLL and .lib's contain the toolset version if the build is
  carried out using Visual Studio 2015 or later, unless the
  'msvc14x-parallel-installable' option is set to be false during configuration.
  
  The reasoning behind this change is that there can be subtle problems when, for
  instance, one tries to link to a Visual Studio 2015-built pangomm when building
  items dependening on pangomm with Visual Studio 2017 or 2019.  This is
  unfortunate as Microsoft did try hard to make interoperating between binaries
  built with Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 as easy as possible in terms of ABI
  and API, but unfortunately this can hit the corner cases where this
  compatibility does not work.
  
  As the name suggests, this attempts to make Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019
  builds share a single set of underlying C DLLs easier, while avoiding breakages
  caused by such subtle differences.

2020-06-29  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson: Use pkg-config to find glibmm and cairomm for all builds

  Stop manually looking for glibmm and cairomm for better consistency, as:
  
  -Items that depended on glibmm which added Meson build support after glibmm,
   such as gtkmm and libxml++ also required glibmm to be found via pkg-config
   files, and they still had NMake Makefile support for Visual Studio builds.
   For items that use cairomm directly, this will be the case as well.
  -There could be corner cases on the glibmm and cairomm libraries that pangomm
   links to in  terms of ABI compatibility between Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and
   2019.

2020-06-16  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Distinguish between MSVC 2015, 2017 and 2019

  It was found that we cannot rely on the fact that Visual Studio
  2015~2019 tried very hard to be binary compatible, as there can be
  corner cases when linking against pangomm built with Visual Studio 2015
  with builds done by Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 where the code will fail to
  link and the DLLs are therefore not ABI-compatible.  Note that the
  libsigc++ DLLs, however, are ABI compatible between these 3 Visual
  Studio versions.
  
  As a result, for the DLL and LIB names, use 'vc140' for Visual Studio
  2015 builds, 'vc141' for Visual Studio 2017 builds and 'vc142' for
  Visual Studio 2019 builds, according to the toolset versions as defined
  by Microsoft.
  
  For people that may have previously built pangomm with Visual Studio 2017
  or 2019, which had 'vc140' in the built .lib and DLL, an NMake option
  'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' is added to make building such binaries with 'vc140'
  easier, if needed.

  meson: Clean up Visual Studio bits

  Streamline how we look for the dependencies manually, by using the
  'has_headers:' attribute of cpp_compiler.find_library(), so that we can
  check for the presence of the headers at the same time as looking for
  the glibmm, cairomm and/or libsigc++ headers.

2020-05-05  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson: Ignore warning C4275 on Visual Studio

  Since we are basically using __declspec(dllimport) from dependent
  -mm libraries that are on the same CRT, we could just disregard this
  warning.

2020-05-05  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson/Visual Studio: Support cairomm lookup using pkg-config

  cairomm recently received Meson build support, which will generate the
  pkg-config files for us, so try to look for cairomm first using
  pkg-config, before looking for it manually.
  
  Since cairomm's pkg-config file also pulls in libsigc++, we can also
  skip looking for libsigc++ if we found cairomm via pkg-config.

2020-05-05  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Support Meson-built cairomm

  Meson build: Avoid some recompilations, and other changes

  * MSVC_NMake/filelist.am: Remove pangomm/copy-pangommconfig-h.py.
  * MSVC_NMake/pangomm/copy-pangommconfig-h.py: Removed file.
  * MSVC_NMake/pangomm/meson.build: Copy pangommconfig.h with configure_file().
  * Makefile.am: Distribute tools/dummy-header.py instead of tools/dist-cmd.py.
  * docs/reference/meson.build: Rename a variable.
  * meson.build: Rename some variables. Always set gmmproc_dir.
  In maintainer-mode, show its value in the summary.
  * pango/meson.build: Set pangommconfig_h.
  * pango/pangomm/meson.build: Create dummy_header.h, depending on all
  generated headers. It guarantees that all generated headers are built
  before pangomm_library is built, at the same time avoiding unnecessary
  recompilations.
  * tools/dist-cmd.py: Removed file. It's not necessary in add_dist_script()
  when the first parameter is python3.path().
  * tools/dummy-header.py: New file.
  * untracked/README: Mention check-dllexport-usage.py.

2020-04-04  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Detect whether we can use __declspec(dllexport)

  The generated pangomm headers must be generated with a recent gmmproc so
  that we may ensure that all the needed classes, functions and methods
  are marked with PANGOMM_API, so that we can build pangomm without using
  gendef.exe.
  
  If the headers are generated with an older gmmproc, then we build
  pangomm using gendef.exe, as we did before.

2020-04-04  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson.build: Build pangomm as a shared lib if possible

  Make the build files directly build pangomm as a shared library on:
  -All non-Visual Studio builds, as we did initially.
  -Visual Studio builds that have the headers generated from their .hg
   counterparts with gmmproc 2.64.3 or later.  gmmproc 2.64.3 has the
   updates that are necessary to have the generated headers contain build
   macros that could be used to export symbols using compiler directives.
   If it is found that an older gmmproc is being used, fall back to use
   gendef.exe, as we did before, by defining PANGOMM_USE_GENDEF.

2020-04-02  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  pango/src/*.hg: Mark _WRAP_ENUM with decl_prefix

  This way, with the updated gmmproc, we can export the template<> classes
  using PANGOMM_API as well.

2020-04-02  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  pango/pangomm/*.h: Decorate APIs with PANGOMM_API

  This prepares for the export of symbols using compiler directives rather
  than using gendef.exe.

2020-04-02  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  pango/src/*.hg: Decorate classes and functions with PANGOMM_API

  This prepares for using compiler directives to export symbols rather
  than using gendef.exe.

2020-04-02  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  pango/pangommconfig.h.*: Add PANGOMM_API

  This prepares for decoration of the various APIs in pangomm so that we
  can export symbols at least on Visual Studio buids using compiler
  directives, without the need of gendef.exe, if the headers were
  generated from their respective *.hg counterparts with gmmproc 2.64.0 or
  later.

2020-03-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson.build: Use /utf-8 in Visual Studio builds

  ...if it is available.  Also disable warning C4828 as we will get that warning
  when building gendef.exe with /utf-8.

2020-03-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Silence warnings with latest glibmm stable

  The glibmm headers (and pangomm headers in the near future) use compiler
  directives to control symbol export, so we can safely ignore warnings
  C4251 and C4275 as we are certain that we are indeed using these
  compiler directives to import (and later, export) symbols in our builds.

2020-03-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Look also for headers in untracked/

  This way, we fix the NMake builds from Meson-generated dist tarballs.

  NMake Makefiles: Support Meson-built glibmm

  Add the correct naming for the DLLs and .lib's for glibmm that is built
  with Meson.

2020-03-10  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson: Ignore warning C4251 on MSVC builds

  We might be building against glibmm that is built with
  __declspec(dllexport), meaning that warning C4251 will be generated as
  we are now in-turn using __declspec(dllimport).  We can just ignore this
  compiler warning, since we are pretty sure what we are doing at this
  point.

2020-03-10  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson.build: Look for glibmm with pkg-config on MSVC too

  glibmm gained Meson build support for Visual Studio, so we can first
  try to look for glibmm with pkg-config first, and then fall back to
  manual searching if that cannot be found.
  
  Note that libsigc++ also has a Meson build system as well, but either we
  look for it via glibmm's pkg-config files, or we look for both glibmm
  and libsigc++ manually.
  
  Also support looking for Meson-built libsigc++ .lib's as well if glibmm
  is to be looked for manually.

2020-03-10  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson: Build generate_extra_defs with Visual Studio too

  The NMake Makefiles in glibmm now builds glibmm_generate_extra_defs-2.x.lib,
  so we can make use of it to build generate_extra_defs on Visual Studio too.

2020-03-10  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson: Allow maintainer builds on Visual Studio too

  glibmm recently gained the ability to build with Visual Studio from a GIT
  checkout and to install the PERL scripts used to generate the C++ sources from
  the respective templates, so enable this support for pangomm as well as the
  needed infrastructure are largely in place.
  
  Note that a new configuration option has been added for Visual Studio builds
  to specify the directory for gmmproc, since there is not yet Meson build
  support for building glibmm, meaning glibmm built with Visual Studio does not
  support generating pkg-config files.
  
  Since some portions that we use for non-maintainer builds can be used for
  maintainer builds as well, make them shared to keep additions minimal.

  pango/src/color.hg: Fix call to _CLASS_BOXEDTYPE_STATIC

  Remove all the parameters after the second one, they were originally ignored

  third argument

  NMake Makefiles: Support using Meson-built dependencies

  Add NMake commandline option to use Meson-built libraries so that one will not
  need to update the Makefiles to use them.

  NMake Makefiles: Also install the m4 files

  This way other projects may make use of these to generate the sources

2020-02-27  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Separate outdir and intdir by toolset version

  This reduces the chances of builds by different Visual Studio versions become
  mixed up with other versions, and makes the build tree cleaner.  Note that
  Visaul Studio 2015 through 2019 are treated as the same toolset version since
  they link to the same CRT.

2020-02-27  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Allow builds from a GIT checkout

  ...or a Meson-generated release tarball.
  
  Add targets to the NMake Makefiles which will allow:
  
  -Generating MSVC_NMake/pangomm/pangommconfig.h and
   MSVC_NMake/pangomm/pangomm.rc, needed for GIT checkouts and
   Meson-generated release tarballs
  
  -Generating the sources that need to be generated with gmmproc and
   generate_wrap_init.pl, needed for GIT checkouts, and fix installation
   accordingly.
  
  -Look for sources also in $(srcroot)/untracked, which will be the case
   for Meson-generated release tarballs.

2020-02-27  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Add rules to generate pre-configured items

  This will generate the pangomm.rc and pangommconfig.h files, which are needed

  README.win32: Update info on MSVC builds

  C++11 versions of pangomm support Visual Studio 2013 or later, so ensure
  the right info is conveyed here.  Note that Meson does not have a
  project generator backend for Visual Studio 2013, but does have project
  generator backends for 2015, 2017 and 2019.

2019-11-04  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson: Relax Visual Studio check to 2013

  We are able to build the C++-11 version of pangomm on Visual Studio 2013
  or later, so check for that.
  
  However, since the C++-11 support in Visual Studio is made complete in
  VS 2015, display a warning message to configure the build without
  warnings being fatal, as 2013 builds will spew compiler warnings.
  
  Also, for the C++-11 versions of glibmm, cairomm and sigc++, we don't
  distinguish between whether they are built by Visual Studio 2015, 2017
  nor 2019, so we assume that they will all link to the same .lib's for
  glibmm, cairomm and sigc++, since they should all be compatible in this
  case.  In this case, Meson will warn about C++11 is not supported, but
  it is safe to ignore this warning.

2019-11-03  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjellahlstedt@gmail.com>

  Add support for building pangomm with Meson

  pangomm-1.4 can be built with either Autotools or Meson.
  New and modified files have been copied from the master branch.
  Version info in meson.build, README.win32 and untracked/README has been
  updated to fit pangomm-1.4.

  tools/gen_scripts: Update for non-source-dir builds

  Most modules (e.g. pango) can be built in a directory separated from the
  source directory. Update the scripts that generate .defs and doc.xml files
  to handle that.
  The environment variable JHBUILD_SOURCES is not used any more.
  Instead the environment variables GMMPROC_GEN_SOURCE_DIR and
  GMMPROC_GEN_BUILD_DIR are read. See comments in init_generate.sh.

  Since they have been superseded by the NMake Makefiles, it is time to
  remove them.

2018-10-26  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  build: Add NMake Makefiles

  This adds a set of NMake Makefiles, which will replace the Visual Studio
  2013 projects so that the Visual Studio build files are more flexible
  and easier to maintain.
  
  Note that since this is the C++-11 version of pangomm, for Visual Studio
  2015 and 2017, since they both link to the v140 Windows C/C++ runtime
  DLLs, the pangomm DLL and .lib are named as pangomm-vc140-1_4.[dll|lib]
  or pangomm-vc140-d-1_4.[dll|lib], since these builds can interop.

  C++11: Mark all _CLASS_OPAQUE_REFCOUNTED classes as final.

  Because _CLASS_OPAQUE_REFCOUNTED already generates a comment
  telling us not to derive from them, presumably because they can
  only be instantiated by reinterpret_cast<>ing a base C struct.
  
  Ideally, _CLASS_OPAQUE_REFCOUNTED would add the final keyword,
  but the class line is is not generated, so that would be a little
  difficult.

  configure.ac: Use AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 to check for compiler

  Among other reasons, this is because glibmm now requires C++11,
  and its gmmrpoc generates C++11 code.

  * tools/m4/convert_pango.m4: Added the extra conversions that were in the
  gtkmm copy of this file. They will probably be needed by other modules so
  it makes sense to keep them to here to avoid duplication.

2011-01-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

  Allow other modules to use the m4 files.

  	* codegen/Makefile.am: Install the m4 files, like gtkmm installs its files.
  	* pango/pangomm.pc.in: Add the gmmproc4mdir variable so that other modules such
  	as gtkmm and cluttermm can get the path to the m4 file, to avoid
  	duplicating its contents.

  Fix the build with --enable-warnings=fatal.

  	* configure.ac: Add no-long-long to avoid a warning caused by a newer glib.
  	Also avoid use of deprecated GLIBMM API and make sure that GSEAL is defined.

  Include convert_glibmm.m4 instead of convert_gtkmm.m4.

  * tools/m4/convert.m4: Inlcude convert_glibmm.m4, just added to glibmm,
  instead of convert_gtkmm.m4, which glibmm no longer provides.
  Also include convert_pangomm.m4 - we probably used the copy in glibmm until
  now.
